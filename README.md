# üß™ Playwright Tests for DemoQA Elements

This repository contains automated UI tests written in **TypeScript** using **Playwright**.  
The tests cover the **Elements** section of the [demoqa.com](https://demoqa.com/) website, including form validation, links, and UI feedback messages.

My project uses Playwright with TypeScript to automate both UI and API tests for the DemoQA website. The tests focus on core user workflows such as login, form validation, navigation via links, and CRUD operations on items/books through API endpoints.

UI Tests: Cover scenarios like valid/invalid login, new account creation, button states, link validation, and UI feedback messages. These tests verify element presence, input validations, button enabling/disabling, and message displays to ensure the frontend behaves correctly.
API Tests: Use Playwright‚Äôs API testing capabilities to automate CRUD operations on backend endpoints, including creating users, adding books, editing, and deleting items. Both positive and negative cases are included to validate proper API behavior and error handling.
Test Organization: Tests are well-structured under separate folders (tests/ for UI, tests/api/ for API) for clarity and maintainability.
Execution & Reporting: Tests can be run selectively or fully across browsers via CLI commands, and test failures generate trace files for easier debugging. You also have plans or partial setup for CI integration via GitHub Actions.
Overall: Your approach balances comprehensive functional coverage with maintainable code, leveraging Playwright‚Äôs all-in-one framework for end-to-end automation in a simple and efficient way.---

üìù Additional Notes

API tests are located in the tests/api folder and cover REST endpoints such as login, adding/editing/deleting books or items.
Test reports and traces are generated automatically on failures for easier debugging.
GitHub Actions are configured to run tests automatically on push and pull requests.
üìñ Test Plan / Strategy (Summary)

What is being tested: UI functionality (login, form validation, UI elements) and API endpoints (CRUD operations on items/books).
Test coverage: Positive and negative scenarios, including valid/invalid inputs and API error handling.
Tools used: Playwright for UI automation and API testing due to its speed and all-in-one capabilities.
How to run: See instructions above.
Assumptions: Tests require an internet connection and stable access to demoqa.com.
Limitations: Tests are for demo purposes and do not cover every possible edge case or performance testing.
